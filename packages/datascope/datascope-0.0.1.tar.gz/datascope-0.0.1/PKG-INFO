Description: # DataScope: Measuring data importance over ML pipelines using the Shapley value
        
        This is a tool for inspecting ML pipelines by measuring how important is each training data point for predicting the label of a given test data example.
        
        ## Development Guide
        
        ### Setup
        
        #### Install libGL.so for opencv
        ```
        apt-get install ffmpeg libsm6 libxext6  -y
        ```
        
        #### Create a new conda virtual environment
        ```
        conda env create -f datascope.yml
        ```
        
        #### Install datascope
        ```
        python setup.py install
        ```
        
        #### Install datascope-pipelines
        
        ### Repo Structure
        
        This repository has several sections:
        
        * Algorithms for computing the Shapley value are in `datascope/algorithms`
        * Code for inspecting ML pipelines defined with sklearn are in `datascope/inspection`
        * All tests are stored under `tests`
        * Any experiment scripts and Jupyter notebooks are stored under `experiments`
        
        ### Adding Dependencies
        
        For now we can keep all Python dependencies in the `requirements.txt`. Later on we will separate them by "flavor" (e.g. test dependencies, experiment dependencies).
