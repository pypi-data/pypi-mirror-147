        # Introduction
        This project has an extremely trivial goal. Simply input 3 values relating to the throw of a dart
        - tilt angle
        - swivel angle (both in degrees)
        - initial velocity (in metres per second).
        
        Then output the score of which is obtained. This project involves many areas of mathematics to solve.
        Primarily Mechanics and Geometry.
        
        # Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install cfmdarts.
        
        ```bash
        pip install cfmdarts
        ```
        NOTE: It is recommended to have a Python version which is greater that 3.6 to be installed.
        
        # Tutorial
        
        In order to use cfmdarts is really simple. To use in your project, you type
        
        ```python
        import cfmdarts
        ```
        
        # How To Guides
        
        These next guides are simple pieces of code to get you started using cfmdarts.
        
        ## Creating a new Projectile object.
        
        ```python
        import cfmdarts
        
        #Creating a new Projectile object called Object1
        #with tilt_angle=2, swivel_angle=1.5 and initial_velocity=21
        
        Object1 = Projectile(2,1.5,21)
        ```
        
        ## Outputting a new Projectile objects range, height and shift values.
        ```python
        import cfmdarts
        
        #Creating a new Projectile object called Object1
        #with tilt_angle=2, swivel_angle=1.5 and initial_velocity=21
        
        Object1 = Projectile(2,1.5,21)
        
        ##This outputs the follow
        print(Object1.range())
        print(Object1.height())
        print(Object1.shift())
        ```
        Output:
        ```bash
        2.370812418203357
        0.02019783552359672
        0.06206063411897303
        ```
        
        ## Creating a coordinates object to calculate and output the cartesian and polar coordinates
        ```python
        import cfmdarts
        
        #Creating a coordinates object called coord1
        #with tilt_angle=2, swivel_angle=1.5 and initial_velocity=21
        
        Coord1 = coordinates(2,1.5,21)
        
        ## These two statements below print out the
        ## cartesian and polar coordinates.
        print(Coord1.cartesian_coordinates())
        print(Coord1.polar_coordinates())
        ```
        Output:
        ```bash
        [0.06206063411897303, 0.02019783552359672]
        [0.06526465250874554, 18.027647207949578]
        ```
        
        ## Creating a data simulation using the dart_simulation that returns a final score.
        ```python
        import cfmdarts
        
        #Creating a variable called 'simulation1'.
        simulation1 = dart_simulation(2, 1.5, 21)
        
        ##Outputs the final score from simulation1
        print(simulation1)
        ```
        Output:
        ```bash
        13
        ```
        
        ## Example of a dart simulation that has an incorrect input case with tilt_angle being an invalid input 
        ```python
        import cfmdarts
        
        #Creating a variable called 'simulation1'.
        simulation1 = dart_simulation(-91, 2, 29)
        
        ##Outputs the final score from simulation1
        print(simulation1)
        ```
        Output:
        ```bash
        null shot, please ensure the tilt and swivel angles are both between -90 and 90, and that the velocity is positive
        ```
        
        # Explanation
        
        ## Phase I - Projectile In 3D
        
        We must first consider the 2-dimensional plane $(x,y)$ in which our dart
        travels through. Doing, we can model the trajectory of the dart using projectile motion
        in order to obtain the range, height, and shift of the dart relative to the bullseye. We can say that air resistance of the dart is negligible.
        
        ## Phase II - Geometry Of Dartboard
        
        Determining the score is precisely the same as determining the position at which the dart landed
        on the dartboard. We will obtain (via the specified throw) 2 distances relative to the distance from the
        bullseye.
        Using these 2 values as Cartesian coordinates, we can translate the position into polar form $r, \theta $ via similar methods to determining the modulus and argument of a complex number. See the ``coordinates" class in how this was achieved.
