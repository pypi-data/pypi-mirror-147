        Usage: telepathy [OPTIONS]

        **A note on how Telegram works**
        
        Telegram chats are organised into two [key types][2]: channels and megagroups/supergroups. Each module works slightly differently depending on the chat type. For example, subscribers of Channels can't be scraped with the *members.py* module. Channels can have seemingly unlimited subscribers, megagroups can have up to 200,000 members.
        
        ** Upcoming changes **
        With the release of the Telepathy CLI interface, the toolkit has entered its next stage of production. Despite this, some bugs may still be present and some features are yet to be added. In some environments (particularly Windows), Telepathy struggles to effectively manage files and can sometimes produce errors. Fixes for these errors will come in due course.
        
        Upcoming features include:
          - Re-adding a time specification flag for the archive module to set archiving for specific period.
          - Giving the archiver module the ability to archive comments on channel posts.
          - Reintroducing batch archiving based on a to_archive.csv.
          - Reintroducing advanced tools as part of the package.
