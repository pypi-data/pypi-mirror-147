"""The series should have sensical values for the limits.

<p>Each sensor or lab measuring equipment has an inherent measurement range. Outside of this range
the readings from the sensor are unreliable. This information is typically present in the
sensor specification sheet.
Traditional historians also allow setting limits (often Low-Low, Low, High and High-High limits).
These limits are often based on process safety concerns or indeed taken from the normal operating range.
In all cases having access to these limits is essential for interpreting readings from the equipment.
Because of time constraints or as a placeholder it can occur that for all limits a zero value is filled in.
It is also possible that due to simple oversight the limits are switched and for instance the higher limit
is less than the lower limit</p>
<p class="scoring-explanation">The score for this check is a simple boolean (True / False).
This check belongs to the score group Limits.
If this check is True, it means that the score for group Limits will be 0%.
</p>
<div class="ts-check-impact">
<p>Missing or badly configured limits can cause missing warning signs of abnormal situations both
in the process as well as with the instrumentation.
