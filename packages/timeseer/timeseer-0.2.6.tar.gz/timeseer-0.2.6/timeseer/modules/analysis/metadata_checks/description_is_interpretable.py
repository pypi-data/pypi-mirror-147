"""The description should not be one character or all the same characters.

<p class="scoring-explanation">The score for this check is a simple boolean (True / False).
This check belongs to the score group Description.
If this check is True, it means that the score for group Description will be 0%.</p>
<div class="ts-check-impact">
<p>An interpretable description of series aids in onboarding and analysis by 3rd
parties that are less familiar with the process.
Due to time constraints sometimes the non-descriptive name of the series is copied for the description.
A good description provides information on the type as well as location of the sensor.
