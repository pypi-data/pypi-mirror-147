Triple the value of a number:

...     """Compute three times X."""
>>> fn(triple, 3)
9
```

Compute factorials using recursion:

```python
>>> from functon import defun, fn, IF
>>> def factorial(N: int) -> defun((IF, ("=", "N", 1), 1, ("*", "N", ("factorial", ("-", "N", 1))))):
...     """Compute the factorial of N."""
>>> fn(factorial, 5) 
120
```
