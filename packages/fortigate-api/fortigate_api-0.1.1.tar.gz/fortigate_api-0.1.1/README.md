# fortigate-api

Python package to configure Fortigate (Fortios) devices using REST API. With this package, you can
create, delete, get, update the any objects on the firewall. The most commonly used objects
implemented in the methods of this package, but you can manipulate any other objects that you can
access via the API.

## Installation

```bash
pip install fortigate-api
```

## Methods for any object

All above listed objects have methods: create, delete, get, update. Params for objets _policy_ and _
snmp_community_ are different from the others (id instead of name). More details in method
docstrings (in code).

    Method  REST API    Description                     Params

## Methods for specific objects

Some objects have specific methods. For example method _move_ is implemented only for object policy.

docstrings (in code).

    Objects                 Action      Description

### Firewall API connector

    param       Required/Optional   Defaul  Description
    ==========  ==================  ======  ===========
    host        mandatory                   Firewall ip address or hostname
    username    mandatory                   Administrator name
    password    mandatory                   Administrator password
    port        optional            443     HTTPS port to REST API interface
    timeout     optional            15      Ssession timeout (minutes)
    vdom        optional            root    Name of virtual domain

Firewall connector with minimum required params

```pycon
from fortigate_api import FortigateAPI
fgt = FortigateAPI(host="hostname", username="admin", password="secret")
```

Firewall connector with optional params

```pycon
fgt = FortigateAPI(host="hostname", username="admin", password="secret",
                   port=1443, timeout=60, vdom="name")
```

### Configuring Address objects on Fortigate

Unique identifier for address object is _name_. Pointing address by _name_ you will get only one
object. Address data example for FortiOS v6.4 [examples/address.yml](examples/address.yml)

#### Get all addresses

```pycon
addresses = fgt.address.get()
```

#### Get address by name

```pycon
address = fgt.address.get(name="127.0.0.100_30")
```

#### Get addresses by one param

Get all addresses with type _ipmask_. Filters:
"==" - type is equal to _ipmask_.

```pycon
addresses = fgt.address.get(filter="type==ipmask")
```

#### Get addresses by multiple params

Get all addresses where type is _fqdn_ and comment field contains _description_. Filters:
"==" - type is equal to _fqdn_,
"=@" - comment field contains _description_ string.

```pycon
addresses = fgt.address.get(filters=["type==fqdn", "comment=@description", ])
```

#### Create address

```pycon
data = dict(type="ipmask", name="127.0.0.100_30", subnet="127.0.0.100 255.255.255.252")
response = fgt.address.create(data=data)
```

#### Update address

```pycon
data = dict(name="127.0.0.100_30", comment="description")
response = fgt.address.update(data=data)
```

#### Delete address

```pycon
response = fgt.address.delete(name="127.0.0.100_30")
```

### Configuring Policy objects on Fortigate

Unique identifier for policy object is _id_. Pointing policy by _id_ you will get only one object.
Pointing policy by _name_ you can get multiple objects. Policy data example for FortiOS
v6.4 [examples/policy.yml](examples/policy.yml)

#### Get all policies

```pycon
policies = fgt.policy.get()
```

#### Get policy by id

Pointing policy by _policyid_ you will get only one object.

```pycon
policy = fgt.policy.get(policyid=1)
```

#### Get policies by name

Pointing policy by _name_ you can get multiple object.

```pycon
policy = fgt.policy.get(name="policy1")
```

#### Get policies by one param

Get all policies with status _enable_. Filters: "==" - status is equal to _fqdn_.

```pycon
policies = fgt.policy.get(filter="status==enable")
```

#### Get policies by multiple params

Get all policies where status is _disable_ and comments field contains _description_. Filters:
"==" - status is equal to _disable_,
"=@" - comments field contains _description_ string.

```pycon
policies = fgt.policy.get(filters=["status==disable", "comments=@description"])
```

#### Create policy

```pycon
data = dict(name="policy1", srcaddr="127.0.0.100_30", dstaddr="127.0.0.104_30")
response = fgt.policy.create(data=data)
```

#### Update policy

```pycon
data = dict(policyid=1, comment="description")
response = fgt.policy.update(data=data)
```

#### Delete policy by id

```pycon
response = fgt.policy.delete(policyid=1)
```

#### Delete all policies with name

```pycon
response = fgt.policy.delete(name="policy1")
```

#### Move policy to before/after other neighbor-policy

```pycon
response = fgt.policy.move(policyid=1, position="after", neighbor=2)
```
