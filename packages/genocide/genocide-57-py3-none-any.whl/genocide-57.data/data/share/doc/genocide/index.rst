**GENOCIDE** contains :ref:`correspondence <correspondence>` with the International
Criminal Court, asking for the prosecution of the king of the netherlands and
members of the first chamber for the genocide they are committing with their new
treatement laws.

Since the members of the :ref:`chamber <chamber>` and the :ref:`king <king>`
were aware that these medicine are :ref:`poison <evidence>` at the time they
voted for this law and the day the Wfz law took effect (1-1-2019), i ask the 
prosecutor to prosecute the king for making the commiting of the above mentioned
crimes (killing, torture and impotent making) possible here in the netherlands
in the hope that it stops the mass torture with poison the king of the
netherlands and his government are doing.
 
Current status is an outside the jurisdiction judgement of the prosecutor which
requires a :ref:`reconsider <reconsider>` to have the king actually arrested.
