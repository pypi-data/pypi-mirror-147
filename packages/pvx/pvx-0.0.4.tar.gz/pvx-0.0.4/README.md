# üêç pvx

Python version &amp; venv management (maybe more ...)

## ü§™ What can pvx do ?

![pvx-help](./asset/pvx-help.png)

## üì¶ Install

Use pipx (recommend)

```bash
pipx install pvx
```

Or pip

```bash
pip install pvx
```

Don't forget [`python-build`](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/tree/master/plugins/python-build) and it [dependencies](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv/wiki#suggested-build-environment).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv.git ~/.pyenv
```
[pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) is usually installed at `~/.pyenv` by default. If it is installed silently, then everything is ready, otherwise add `PVX_PY_BUILD_PATH=/your/pyenv/path/plugins/python-build` to `env` (`plugins/python-build` is usually fixed).

## üîß Usage

- List  version number that you can download.

    ```bash
    pvx py archive 

    # If you want to filter it, do this
    pvx py archive 3.10
    ```

- Install.

    ```bash
    pvx py insetall 3.10.4
    ```

- List versions of installed.

    ```bash
    pvx py list
    ```

- Remove the specified version of Python.

    ```bash
    pvx py remove 3.10.4
    ```

- Create a virtual environment (pvx use [Python Venv](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html) and compatible with its parameters)

    ```bash
    # All default (current python and default venv prompt)
    pvx venv new

    # Specify the version (which install by pvx)
    pvx venv new 3.10.4

    # Use existing Python
    pvx venv new ~/.pyenv/versions/3.10.4/bin/python

    # Use venv's parameters, such as specifying prompt
    pvx venv new 3.10.4 --prompt venv_prompt_name

    # Use current python and venv's parameters
    pvx venv new --prompt venv_prompt_name
    ```

- List all virtual environments

    ```bash
    # You'll see a table , highlight the activate one.
    pvx venv list
    ```

- Activate virtual environment with `PROMPT`

    ```bash
    # use `pvx venv list` to show prompt
    pvx venv activate prompt_name
    ```

- Remove virtual environment with `PROMPT`

    ```bash
    # use `pvx venv list` to show prompt
    pvx venv remove prompt_name
    ```

## Optional environment variable

- `PVX_ROOT_PATH`: pvx home path. `Default: ~/.pvx`
- `PVX_PYTHON_INSTALLATION_PATH`: The installation folder for Python. `Default: ~/${PVX_ROOT_PATH}/versions`
- `PVX_VENV_IN_PROJECT`: Whether the virtual environment is installed in the project. `Default: true`
- `PVX_VENV_DIR_NAME_IN_PROJECT`: The folder name of virtual environment. `Default: .venv`
- `PVX_VENV_EXTERNAL_PATH`: If `PVX_VENV_IN_PROJECT` is false, the virtual environment is installed externally rather than in the project. `Default: ~/${PVX_ROOT_PATH}/venv`
- `PVX_PY_BUILD_HOME`: pyenv plugin python-build home path. `Default: ~/.pyenv/plugins/python-build`

## üåü Extend functionality

If you want to extend commands, be familiar with the following points.

1. The folder where the `pvx.py` file resides is the `root`.
2. `root/commands` is the folder where the `.py` command scripts are stored.
3. If `filenamed` is true, use the file name command, otherwise use the argument to `@click.command`.
        - The `.py` files are named `pvx_{group}_{command}.py`.For example: `pvx_py_install.py`, which means we can call it with `pvx py install`.
4. `.py` file must have a method called `cli` and decorated with `@click.command` .

## üëª Thanks

pvx was my experiment after studying `pyenv`, `poetry` `rich` and `click`. Thank them for their efforts, fun üòÅ ~
