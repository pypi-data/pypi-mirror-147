# Thoth 𓅝

Thoth is designed to be an interactive explanation of a number of common Machine Learning methods. Built upon [Streamlit](https://www.streamlit.io/), Thoth offers an intuitive way to understand and experiment with fundamental AI tools and methods.

## Installation

The easiest way to get started with Thoth is through [pipx](https://pypa.github.io/pipx/). Once you have installed pipx by following their installation instructions, you can install Thoth by running the following command:

```bash
pipx install thoth-ml
```

Alternatively, if you don't need Thoth to be installed in its own environment, then you can simply install it with pip

```bash
pip install --user thoth-ml
```

You can then start the Thoth application by simply running the following:

```bash
thoth
```
