Now you are familiar with the dataset, and have a grasp on which features are most informative, it is time to train a decision tree to classify the data! For this tree, we have withheld 20% of the dataset (stratified by class) as a test set, with the other 80% being used to train the decision tree. 



You can adjust some of the key hyperparameters of the model, and see how they affect the final tree that gets produced, as well as the performance metrics on the train and test set. Start by playing around with some of the simple pre-pruning parameters, then explore some more advanced controls.
