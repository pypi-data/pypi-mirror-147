Additional Help and FAQ
========================

| **Where are the praw.ini file and data located?**
| On Linux and Mac, the praw.ini file is stored under ``/home/your_username/.config/tadr``, and the data (currently only the log file) folder is stored at ``/home/your_username/tadr/data``. On Windows, the directories are ``C:\your_username\AppData\Roaming\tadr`` and ``C:\your_username\AppData\Roaming\tadr\data``, respectively.

| **What if I already have a praw.ini on my computer?**
| Saving in a ``tadr`` subfolder prevents TADR from overwriting this ini, and the program is designed to only pull from that file.

| **How can I contact the developer?**
| I'm reachable through ``murdomaclachlan@duck.com``. You can also `open an issue on GitHub <https://github.com/MurdoMaclachlan/tadr/issues>`_ if needed.
