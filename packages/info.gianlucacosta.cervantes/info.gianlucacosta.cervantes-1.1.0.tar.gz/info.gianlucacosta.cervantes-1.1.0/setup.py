    'long_description': "# Cervantes\n\n_Extract a compact Spanish dictionary from Wikcionario, with elegance_\n\nIn Spanish literature - and all over the world - the works of [Miguel de Cervantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes) are considered an _obra maestra_ because of their stylistic 🦋elegance, witty remarks and _humanistic_ depth of thought...\n\n...which is why I wish to dedicate this project to his memory: more precisely, this is my library for creating _a customized, Wiktionary-based corpus of the Spanish language_.\n\n**Cervantes** is a type-checked library for Python, built on top of [WikiPrism](https://github.com/giancosta86/WikiPrism), focusing on:\n\n- _Parsing_ an [XML dump](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/eswiktionary/latest/eswiktionary-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2) of [Wikcionario](https://es.wiktionary.org/) and extracting _Spanish terms_ from each wiki page\n\n- _Classifying_ each term according to a set of _grammar categories_\n\n- Providing _a Spanish-related Dictionary_, backed by a SQLite db, that can be used for custom analysis via _SQL queries_\n\nDespite its sophisticated _regex-based engine_, Cervantes has a minimalist programming interface; furthermore, it is designed to be a core plugin of [Jardinero](https://github.com/giancosta86/Jardinero) - which makes it extremely simple to use, via a web-application user interface.\n\nNo matter the scenario, it is essential to explore the SQL schema of its underlying database: for details, please consult the sections below.\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install **Cervantes**, just run:\n\n```bash\npip install info.gianlucacosta.cervantes\n```\n\nor, if you are using Poetry:\n\n```bash\npoetry add info.gianlucacosta.cervantes\n```\n\n## Extracting a custom dictionary from Wikcionario\n\nOnce Cervantes is installed in your Python environment, you can import it just like any other Python library...\n\n...or you can run it as an extension module within Jardinero's infrastructure! 🥳\n\nJust make sure that both [Jardinero](https://github.com/giancosta86/Jardinero) and Cervantes are installed, then run:\n\n```bash\npython -OO -m info.gianlucacosta.jardinero info.gianlucacosta.cervantes\n```\n\nYou will then be able to create a dictionary and perform SQL queries via Jardinero's web user interface.\n\nCervantes also supports Jardinero's _developer mode_: in that case, the system will refer to your local copy of Wikcionario - which **must** be a BZ2 archive residing at the following address:\n\n> http://localhost:8000/eswiktionary-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2\n\nUsually, you can make this URL available by running:\n\n```bash\npython -m http.server\n```\n\nfrom within the directory containing your [Wikcionario dump file](https://dumps.wikimedia.org/eswiktionary/latest/eswiktionary-latest-pages-articles.xml.bz2).\n\nFor a more detailed explanation about the developer mode, please refer to Jardinero's documentation.\n\n## Database schema\n\nEvery single table in the database created by Cervantes has two fields:\n\n- **entry** (TEXT NOT NULL) - denoting the term within the dictionary\n\n- **pronunciation** (TEXT) - the IPA pronunciation, with an ASCII apostrophe character (and not a more sophisticated Unicode symbol) before the syllable having the primary stress\n\nGiven the nature of the extraction process, there are no foreign keys enforcing consistency between tables (for example, between **verbs** and **verb_forms**) - but one can still perform JOINs according to one's needs.\n\n### Table: prepositions\n\n| Field         | Type | Required | Primary key |\n| ------------- | ---- | :------: | :---------: |\n| entry         | TEXT |    \\*    |     \\*      |\n| pronunciation | TEXT |          |             |\n\n### Table: interjections\n\n| Field         | Type | Required | Primary key |\n| ------------- | :--: | :------: | :---------: |\n| entry         | TEXT |    \\*    |     \\*      |\n| pronunciation | TEXT |          |             |\n\n### Table: conjunctions\n\n| Field         | Type | Required | Primary key |\n| ------------- | :--: | :------: | :---------: |\n| entry         | TEXT |    \\*    |     \\*      |\n| pronunciation | TEXT |          |             |\n\n### Table: adverbs\n\n| Field         | Type | Required | Primary key |\n| ------------- | :--: | :------: | :---------: |\n| entry         | TEXT |    \\*    |     \\*      |\n| pronunciation | TEXT |          |             |\n| kind          | TEXT |          |     \\*      |\n\n### Table: verbs\n\n| Field         | Type | Required | Primary key |\n| ------------- | :--: | :------: | :---------: |\n| entry         | TEXT |    \\*    |     \\*      |\n| pronunciation | TEXT |          |             |\n| kind          | TEXT |          |     \\*      |\n\n### Table: pronouns\n\n| Field         | Type | Required | Primary key |\n| ------------- | :--: | :------: | :---------: |\n| entry         | TEXT |    \\*    |     \\*      |\n| pronunciation | TEXT |          |             |\n| kind          | TEXT |          |     \\*      |\n\n### Table: articles\n\n| Field         | Type | Required | Primary key |\n| ------------- | :--: | :------: | :---------: |\n| entry         | TEXT |    \\*    |     \\*      |\n| pronunciation | TEXT |          |             |\n| kind          | TEXT |          |     \\*      |\n\n### Table: adjectives\n\n| Field           | Type | Required | Primary key |\n| --------------- | :--: | :------: | :---------: |\n| entry           | TEXT |    \\*    |     \\*      |\n| pronunciation   | TEXT |          |             |\n| reference_entry | TEXT |          |     \\*      |\n\n### Table: nouns\n\n| Field           | Type | Required | Primary key |\n| --------------- | :--: | :------: | :---------: |\n| entry           | TEXT |    \\*    |     \\*      |\n| pronunciation   | TEXT |          |             |\n| gender          | TEXT |    \\*    |     \\*      |\n| number_trait    | TEXT |          |             |\n| reference_entry | TEXT |          |     \\*      |\n\n### Table: verb_forms\n\n| Field         | Type | Required | Primary key |\n| ------------- | :--: | :------: | :---------: |\n| entry         | TEXT |    \\*    |     \\*      |\n| pronunciation | TEXT |          |             |\n| infinitive    | TEXT |    \\*    |     \\*      |\n| mode          | TEXT |    \\*    |     \\*      |\n| tense         | TEXT |          |     \\*      |\n| person        | TEXT |          |     \\*      |\n\n## The API\n\nEven though this library is designed for [Jardinero](https://github.com/giancosta86/Jardinero), one can still use its functions in other Python programs - mostly in a custom subclass of [WikiPrism](https://github.com/giancosta86/WikiPrism)'s **PipelineStrategy**.\n\nAs a matter of fact, one just needs a few functions from the **info.gianlucacosta.cervantes** namespace:\n\n- **extract_terms(page: Page) -> list\\[SpanishTerm\\]**: given a page, returns a list of Spanish terms from the page - and whose types can be imported from the **info.gianlucacosta.cervantes.terms** namespace. In WikiPrism's model, this function is a **TermExtractor\\[SpanishTerm\\]**\n\n* **create_sqlite_dictionary(connection: Connection) -> SpanishSqliteDictionary**: given a SQLite connection, creates a **SqliteDictionary** (from WikiPrism) that will become its owner and that can be used to read and write Spanish terms. Consequently, it is a **SqliteDictionaryFactory\\[SpanishTerm\\]**\n\n## Parting thoughts\n\n**Cervantes** is a project that I created because I definitely needed to further explore Spanish morphology: actually, it was the initial kernel of [Jardinero](https://github.com/giancosta86/Jardinero), which I later refactored into a separate library, as well as [WikiPrism](https://github.com/giancosta86/WikiPrism).\n\nSince it relies on a very dynamic source like Wikcionario, and despite the carefully-crafted parsing regular expressions, its output cannot be 100% accurate.\n\nFurthermore, it focuses on the linguistic aspects that I felt more appealing according to my own needs - which means that I had to discard information during the parsing, or even to include aspects that may be unnecessary in a different context.\n\nConsequently... feel free to experiment, and maybe to create your own library! ^\\_\\_^\n\nActually, one can even adopt Cervantes's patterns to create a linguistic module for Jardinero dedicated to another language! 🤩\n\n## Further references\n\n- [Jardinero](https://github.com/giancosta86/Jardinero) - Python/TypeScript React web app for exploring natural languages\n\n- [WikiPrism](https://github.com/giancosta86/WikiPrism) - Parse wiki pages and create dictionaries, fast, with Python\n\n* [Eos-core](https://github.com/giancosta86/Eos-core) - Type-checked, dependency-free utility library for modern Python\n\n* [Miguel de Cervantes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Cervantes)\n",
