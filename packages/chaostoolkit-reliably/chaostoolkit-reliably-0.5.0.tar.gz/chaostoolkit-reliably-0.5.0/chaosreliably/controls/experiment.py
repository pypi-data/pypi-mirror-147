    Control run *before* the execution of an Experiment.

    For a given Experiment, the control creates (if not already created) an
    Experiment

    Entity Context and an Experiment Version Entity Context in the Reliably
    service.

    A unique Experiment Run Entity Context is also created, with an Experiment
    Event. Entity Context of type `EXPERIMENT_START` created, relating to the
    run.

    The control requires the `arguments` of `commit_hash`, `source`, and `user`
    to be provided to the control definition. If not provided, the control will
    simply not create any Entity Contexts.

    Once the Entity Contexts have been created, an entry into the configuration
    is made under configuration["chaosreliably"]["experiment_run_labels"] to
    allow for other controls to create events relating to the Experiment Run.
