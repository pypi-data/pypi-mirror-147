    """The Soil Moisture Accounting and Routing for Transport [SMART] model
    (`Mockler et al., 2016 <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2015.08.015>`_)
    is a bucket-type rainfall-runoff model.

    SMART is an enhancement of the SMARG (Soil Moisture Accounting and
    Routing with Groundwater) lumped, conceptual rainfallâ€“runoff model
    developed at National University of Ireland, Galway (`Kachroo, 1992`_),
    and based on the soil layers concept (`O'Connell et al., 1970`_;
    `Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970`_). Separate soil layers were introduced
    to capture the decline with soil depth in the ability of plant roots
    to extract water for evapotranspiration. SMARG was originally developed
    for flow modelling and forecasting and was incorporated into the
    Galway Real-Time River Flow Forecasting System [GFFS]
    (`Goswami et al., 2005`_). The SMART model reorganised and extended
    SMARG to provide a basis for water quality modelling by separating
    explicitly the important flow pathways in a catchment.

    The open water component of SMART consists in routing the streamflow
    through the river network by means of a linear reservoir.
