DataTour
---

Seeing is important. `datatour` - allows you to see your data in it's native dimension.
Currently implemented as a `plotly` scatter plot projected from it's original dimension in the 2D on the screen with timeline animation inspired by GrandTour and common sense.



---
Installation
---

Available via pip:
```
pip install datatour
```

---
Usage

If you have array of feature vectors `f`: `shape(shape)==(n_smpl, n_dim)`, you can create data tour object, and display it:

```
from datatour import DataTour as dt

ndv = dt(f)
ndv.display()
```
By default selects randomly `n_subsample=500` samples for efficiency reason.



Also check examples:

```
dt().display()
```
[here goes picture]


```
ndv = dt(example='sphere')
ndv.display(color='z_scaled')
```
