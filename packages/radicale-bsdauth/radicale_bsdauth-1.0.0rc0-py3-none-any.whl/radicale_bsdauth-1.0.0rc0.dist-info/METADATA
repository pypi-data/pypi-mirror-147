# OpenBSD Authentication plugin for Radicale

This connects a [radicale](https://radicale.org/) install to the local
OpenBSD's [authenticate(3)](http://man.openbsd.org/authenticate.3) system
that it is installed on. It means you can access your calendars with the
same password you use for ssh and email.

If you haven't looked into it before, authenticate(3) is like Linux's [PAM(8)](https://man.archlinux.org/man/pam.8) --
a way to log in with multiple ways to prove your identity, from passwords to LDAP to YubiKeys.


## Installation 

This has only been tested against radicale>=3, which is not yet packaged for OpenBSD, so you must install that version manually:

```
doas pkg_add python3
doas pip install --upgrade pip
doas pip install "radicale>=3"

# ( these rest of these steps would normally be handled by pkg_add )
doas useradd -d /var/lib/radicale -m -L daemon -r 1..999 _radicale
cat <<EOF | doas tee /etc/rc.d/radicale && chmod +x /etc/rc.d/radicale
#!/bin/ksh

daemon="/usr/local/bin/radicale"
daemon_user="_radicale"

. /etc/rc.d/rc.subr

rc_start() {
        ${rcexec} "${daemon} ${daemon_flags} &"
}

pexp="/usr/local/bin/python3 /usr/local/bin/radicale"

rc_cmd $1
EOF
```


Then install the plugin:

```
doas pip install radicale_bsdauth
```

In order to function, you also need to grant `radicale` access to authenticate(3):

```
usermod -G auth _radicale
```

And then tell radicale to use it by editing [`/etc/radicale/config` or `/var/lib/radicale/.config/radicale/config`](https://radicale.org/v3.html#configuration) to add

```
[auth]
type = radicale_bsdauth
```
