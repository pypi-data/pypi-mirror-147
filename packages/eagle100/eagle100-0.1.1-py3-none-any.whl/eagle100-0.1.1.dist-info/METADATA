# eagle100
Rainforest EAGLE 100 client (forked from uEagle)

Basic, lightweight client for accessing the local REST API of Rainforest Automation's EAGLE 100 device.

Based off a micropython module, this uses minimal local resources.

This has been forked from [toddsay/uEagle](https://github.com/toddsay/uEagle) to get his fix to [jcalber/uEagle](https://github.com/jcalbert/uEagle) published to PyPi.
Example use:

```python
from eagle100 import Eagle
 
CLOUD_ID = '012abc'
INSTALL_CODE = '0123456789abcdef'
ADDRESS = '192.168.1.123' #optional if your platform can resove mDNS
 
eagle = Eagle(CLOUD_ID, INSTALL_CODE, address=ADDRESS)
 
demand_data = eagle.get_instantaneous_demand()
print('Current Usage: {:.3f} kW'.format(demand_data['Demand']))
```
