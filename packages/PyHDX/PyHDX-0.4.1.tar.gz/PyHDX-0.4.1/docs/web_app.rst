PyHDX web application
=====================

This section will describe a typical workflow of using the main web interface application. Detailed information on each
parameter can be found in the web application reference docs :ref:`web-application-autodoc`. The web application consists of
a sidebar with controls and input, divided into sections, and a main view area with graphs and visualization. We will
go through the functionality of the web interface per section.

Peptide Input
`````````````

Peptide d-uptake data can be added into the web application either in 'Batch' or 'Manual' mode. Use :guilabel:`Input Mode`
to switch between input modes.

When using 'Batch', multiple measurements can be added quickly through an `yaml` file specification.
An example of an `yaml` file can be found in 'tests/test-data' on GitHub.


When using 'Single', each measurement and experimental metadata must be input manually.
Use the :guilabel:`Browse` button to select peptide data files to upload. These should be 'peptide master tables' which
is **long format** data where each entry should at least have the entries of:

 - start (inclusive residue number at which the detected peptide starts, first residue = 1)
 - stop (inclusive residue number at which the detected peptide stops)
 - sequence (sequence of the peptide in one letter amino acid codes)
 - exposure (time of exposure to deuterated solution)
 - uptake (amount/mass (g/mol) of deuterium taken up by the peptide)
 - state (identifier to which 'state' the peptide/protein is in (ie ligands, experimental conditions)

Currently the only data format accepted is exported 'state data' from Waters DynamX, which is .csv format. Exposure
time units is assumed to be minutes. Other data format support can be added on request (eg HDExaminer).

Multiple files can be selected after which these files will be combined. Make sure there are no overlaps/clashes
between 'state' entries when combining multiple files.

Choose which method of back-exchange correction to use. Options are either to use using a fully deuterated sample or
to set a fixed back-exchange percentage for all peptides. The latter method should only be used if no FD sample is
available. A percentage to set here can be obtained by running a back-exchange control once on your setup.

When selecting :guilabel:`FD Sample`, use the fields :guilabel:`FD State` and :guilabel:`FD Exposure` to choose which
peptides from the input should be used as FD control. Note that these peptides will be matched to the ones in the
experiment and peptides without control will not be included.

Use the fields :guilabel:`Experiment State` to choose the 'state' of your experiment. In 'Experiment Exposures' you can select
which exposure times to add include the dataset.

In the :guilabel:`Drop first`'` entry the number of N-terminal residues for each peptides can be chosen which should be ignored when
calculating the maximum uptake for each peptide as they are considered to fully exchange back. Prolines are ignored by
default as they do not have exchangeable amide hydrogens.

Next, specify the percentage of deuterium in the labelling solution in the field :guilabel:`Deuterium percentage`. This
percentage should be as high as possible, typically >90%.

Use the fields :guilabel:`Temperature (K)` and :guilabel:`pH read` to specify the temperature and pH at which the D-labelling
was done. The pH is the value as read from the pH meter without any correction.

The next fields :guilabel:`N term` and :guilabel:`C term` specify the residue number indices of the N-terminal and C-terminal residues, respectively. For the
N-terminal this value is typically equal to 1, but if N-terminal affinity tags are used for purification this might be a
negative number. The value specified should match with the residue indices used in in the input .csv file. The C-term value
tells the software at which index the C-terminal of the protein is, as it is possible that the protein extends beyond the
last residue included in any peptide and as the C-term exhibits different intrinsic rates of exchanges this needs to be
taken into account. A sequence for the full protein (in the N-term to C-term range as specified) can be added to provide
additional sequence information, but this is optional.

Finally, specify a name of the dataset, by default equal to the 'state' value and press 'Add dataset' to add the dataset.
Datasets currently cannot be removed, if you want to remove datasets, press the browser 'refresh' button to start over.

Coverage
````````

The 'Coverage' figure in the main application area rectangles show corresponding to the peptides of a single
timepoint. Peptides are only included if they are in both all the timepoints as well as in the fully deuterated control
sample.

By hovering the mouse over the peptides in the graph, more information is shown about each peptide:

* peptide_id: Index of the peptide per timepoint starting at the first peptide at 0
* start, end: Inclusive, exclusive interval of residue numbers in this peptide (Taking N-terminal resiudues into account)
* RFU: Relative fraction uptake of the peptide
* D(corrected): Absolute D-uptake, corrected by FD control
* sequence: FASTA sequence of the peptide. Non-exchanging N-terminal reisues marked as 'x' and prolines in lower case.


Initial Guesses
```````````````

As a first step in the fitting procedure, initial guesses for the exchange kinetics need to be derived. This can be done
through two options (:guilabel:`Fitting model`): 'Half-life' (fast but less accurate), or 'Association' (slower but more accurate).


Using the 'Association' procedure is recommended. This model fits two time constants the the weighted-averaged uptake kinetics of
each residue. At :guilabel:`Lower bound` and :guilabel:`Upper bound` the bounds of these rate constants can be specified
but in most cases the autosuggested bounds are sufficient. The bounds can be changed per dataset by using the :guilabel:`Dataset`
field or for all datasets at the same time by ticking the :guilabel:`Global bounds` checkbox.
Rarely issues might arise when the initial guess rates are close to the specified bounds at which point the bounds should be
moved to contain a larger interval. This can be checked by comparing the fitted rates *k1* and *k2* (:menuselection:`File Export --> Target dataset --> rates`)
Both rates and associated amplitudes are converted to a single rate value used for initial guesses.
To calcualte guesses, select the model in the drop-down menu, assign a name to these initial guesses and the press
'Calculate Guesses'. The fitting is done in the background. When the fitting is done, the obtained rate is shown in the main area in the
tab 'Rates'. Note that these rates are merely an guesstimate of HDX rates and these rates should not be used for any
interpretation whatsoever but should only function to provide the global fit with initial guesses.

ΔG Fit
``````

After the initial guesses are calculated we can move on the the global fit of the data. Details of the fitting equation
can be found the PyHDX publication (currently `_ACS`_).

At :guilabel:`Initial guess`, select which dataset to use for initial guesses (typically 'Guess_1'). Both previous fits (ΔG values)
or estimated HX rates can be used as initial guesses. The initial guesses can be applied as 'One-to-one', where each protein state
gets initial guesses derived from that state, or 'One-to-many', where one protein state is use as initial guesses for all states.
Users can switch between both modes using :guilabel:`Guess mode`.

At :guilabel:`Fit mode`, users can choose either 'Batch' or 'Single' fitting. If only one datasets is loaded, only 'Single' is
available. If 'Single' is selected, PyHDX will fit ΔG values for each datasets individually using the specified settings.
In 'Batch' mode all data enters the fitting process at the same time. This allows for the use of a second regularizer
between datasets. Note that when using 'Batch' mode, the relative magnitudes of the Mean Squared error losses and
regularizer might be different, such that 'Batch' fitting with ``r2`` at zero is not identical to 'Single' fits.

The fields :guilabel:`Stop loss` and :guilabel:`Stop patience` control the fitting termination. If the loss improvement
is less than `Stop loss` for `Stop patience` epochs (fit iterations), the fitting will terminate.
:guilabel:`Learning rate` controls the step size per epoch. For typical a dataset with 62 peptides over 6 timepoints, the
learning rate should be 50-100. Smaller datasets require larger learning rates and vice versa.

:guilabel:`Momentum` and :guilabel:`Nesterov` are advanced settings for the Pytorch ``SGD`` optimizer.

The maximum number of epochs or fit iterations is set in the field :guilabel:`Epochs`.

Finally, the fields :guilabel:`Regualizer 1` and :guilabel:`Regualizer 2` control the magnitude of the regualizers. Please refer
to our `_ACS`_ publication for more details. In short, ``r1`` acts along consecutive residues and affects as a 'smoothing'
along the primary structure. Higher values give a more smoothed result. This prevents overfitting or helps avoid problems
in the 'non-identifiability' issue where in unresolved (no residue-level overlap) regions the correct kinetic components
can be found (ΔGs of residues given correct choice of timepoints) but it cannot confidently be assigned to residues as
resolution is lacking. The regualizer `r1` biases the fit result towards the residue assignment choice with the lowest
variation along the primary structure. Typical values range from 0.01 to 0.5, depending on size of the input data.

`r2` acts between samples, minimizing variability between them. This is used in differential HDX where users are interested
in ΔG differences (ΔΔG). When measuring HD exchange with differing experimental conditions, such as differences in peptides detected, timepoints
used or D-labelling temperature and pH, the datasets obtained will have different resolution, both 'spatially' (degree of
resolved residues) and 'temporally' (range/accuracy of ΔGs). This can lead to artefactual differences in the final ΔΔG result, as
features might be resolved in out dataset and not in the other, which will show up as ΔΔG.
The penalty from `r2` can be calculated either with respect to a selected reference state (

Specify a unique name at :guilabel:`Fit name` and press :guilabel:`Do Fitting` do start the fit. The :guilabel:`Info log`
in the bottom right corner displays information on when the fit started and finished. The fitting runs in the background
and multiple jobs can be executed at the same time when processing multiple protein states with :guilabel:`Fit mode` set to 'Single'.
However, please take into account that these fits are computationally
intensive and currently if multiple users submit too many jobs it might overwhelm our/your server.

The output ΔG values are shown in the 'ΔG' graph.

See also the :doc:`Fitting example <../examples/03_fitting>` section for more details on fitting and the effect of regualizers.

Differential HDX
````````````````

This control panel can be used to generate differential HDX datasets. Select the fit to use with :guilabel:`Fit_ID`, then
choose which state should be the reference state with :guilabel:`Reference state`. Assign a name to the new comparison and
then click :guilabel:`Add comparison` to calculate ΔΔG values.
The values are calculated by taking each state and subtracting the reference from them (Test - Reference). Therefore if the
test if more flexible (lower ΔG) compared to the test, ΔΔG value are negative and appear on the top of the ΔΔG figure, by default
colored green. Rigids parts are colored purple and are on the bottom of the graph. (note
that the y axis is inverted as for the ΔG figure)
When adding a comparison, ΔRFU values are automatically calculated, independent of the selected :guilabel:`Fit_ID`

Color Transform
```````````````

The color transform panel can be used to update color transforms for each data quantity (rfu, drfu, dG, ddG). Select which quantity
to update with :guilabel:`Target Quantity`. When selecting data quantities, the name of the current color map is shown
below the selector.

:guilabel:`Mode` can be used to select between the available color modes; `Colormap`, `Continuous` and `Discrete`. `Discrete`
splits the ΔG values in `n` categories, which are all assigned the same color. When using `Continuous`, `n` color 'nodes' can be
defined, where color values are interpolated between these nodes. `Color map` allows users to choose a colormap from either the
PyHDX defaults, user defined color maps, or from ``matplotlib`` or ``colorcet``.

The number of categories can be set with :guilabel:`Number of colours`.
When using `Discrete` coloring, the thresholds of the categories can be automatically determined by pressing the :guilabel:`Otsu`
button (using Otsu's method). Use the button :guilabel:`Linear` to distribute threshold values automatically with equal
distances between them, and the extrema at the largest/smallest data values.
A color for residues which are covered by peptides can be chosen at :guilabel:`No coverage`.

Assign an unique name using :guilabel:`Color transform name` and press :guilabel:`Update color transform` to create or
update the color transform.


The colors for the color groups or nodes can be chosen at the bottom of the controllers, as well as the exact position
of the thresholds. These values must be input such that they are always in decreasing order.

Protein Control
```````````````
Selected datasets can be directly visualized on a protein structure using the built in `PDBeMolStar`_ protein viewer.
Use the selector :guilabel:`Input mode` to either directly download a PDB file from the RCSB PDB (specify :guilabel:`Pdb id`)
or to upload a local .pdb file from your computer.

The :guilabel:`Table` selector can be used to choose which of the data tables to use to assign colors to the 3D structure
(RFU, ΔRFU, ΔG or ΔG values). :guilabel:`Visual Style` and :guilabel:`Lighting` can be used to tweak the appearance.

Use the buttons and menu on the protein viewer itself to export the current image to .png format.



Graph Control
`````````````

This section is used to control which dataset is currently show in the graphs. Use the selector :guilabel:`Fit id` to
switch between fit results. The selector :guilabel:`State name` is used to switch between experimental states and
:guilabel:`exposure` to switch between exposure times. The selector :guilabel:`peptide_id` is used to choose which peptide
uptake curve and corresponding fit to show in the Peptide graph.
All corresponding graphs and selector options will update when changing these settings, including the protein view.


We can use these control to inspect the quality of the fit obtained. First, at :guilabel:`Losses` (bottom right) the progress
of the fit can be inspected. This should show a rapid decrease of the 'mse' loss, followed by a mostly flat plateau. If this
is not the case, extend the number of epochs (:guilabel:`epochs` or :guilabel:`stop_loss` and :guilabel:`Stop patience`)
or increase :guilabel:`Learning rate`.

The graph 'Peptide MSE' shows the total mean squared error of all timepoints per peptide. The color scale adjust automatically
so yellow colors do not necessarily reflect a poor fit, but highlight the worst fitted peptides in your dataset. Hover over
the peptide with the mouse to find the index of the peptide and select the peptide with :guilabel:`Peptide index`.



File Export
```````````

All tables which underlie the graphs in the PyHDX web application can be downloaded directly. Choose the the desired dataset
with :guilabel:`Target dataset`. The data can be exported in machine-readable .csv files or
human-readable .txt (pprint) file by setting :guilabel:`Export format`. Make sure to download at least the .csv file for
further.

When selecting a dataset with an assigned color transform, the data can not only be download as a .csv file but also as
(a zip file of) .pml files which contain pymol scripts to directly apply the color map to a structure in pymol, or as .csv/.txt
files with hexadecimal color codes.


Figure Export
`````````````

This panel can be used to export publication quality figures of ΔG or ΔΔG values. Figure options are scatterplot,
linear bars or rainbowclouds and export filetypes can be .png, .pdf, .svg or .eps.

Use the selector :guilabel:`Reference` to set a reference state. This will then export the figures with ΔΔG values. If
set to `None`, figures are exported with ΔG values.

Some parameters of the output figure format (number of columns, aspect ratio, figure width) can be tuned before generating
the figure.

Session Manager
```````````````

From here .zip files can be downloaded which contain all underlying data tables used in the current view. Click
:guilabel:`Export session` to generate the .zip file.
This file can then later be uploaded to recover the current session. At the moment, this only reproduces the data in the
figures. It is not possible to calculate additional ΔG fits after reloading a session. However, exporting figures is possible.
Use `Browse`, select your PyHDX session .zip file and click :guilabel:`Load session` to reload your session.

The button :guilabel:`Reset session` can be used to clear all data. But its probably better to just use the refresh button
in the browser (F5).
