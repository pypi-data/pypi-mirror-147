# MauSPAF
MauSPAF (from the German **MAssen- Und SchwerPunktsAnalyse f√ºr die Flugzeugentwicklung**) is a program used to perform mass properties analysis. While originally developed for aircraft design, it can be used to manage mass properties mass, position and inertias of any technical system.

This module has been developed as a side project during my PhD studies at the [Institute of Structural Mechanics and Lightweight Design at RWTH Aachen University](https://www.sla.rwth-aachen.de).
