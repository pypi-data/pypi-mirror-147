Abstract Runner Module
----------------------

Runner helps you to write plugins for cc_codechecker, providing facilities to
check requirements on current machine about installed softwares and running
projects.

Anyone can write any runner by extending this module and implementing all
necessaries methods. This makes cc_codechecker extensible as pleasure.

If you need to declare other methods than currently defined, prepend their
names with an _ (underscore).

Submit any new plugin requests to daniele.tentoni.1996@gmail.com.

Unit testing
------------

When updating this class, add unit tests to ``test_base_runner.py``.
Usually, when you add another method that raise a NotImplementedException in
his abstract form, add a new argument to ``test_position_raise_exception``
method parametrization.
