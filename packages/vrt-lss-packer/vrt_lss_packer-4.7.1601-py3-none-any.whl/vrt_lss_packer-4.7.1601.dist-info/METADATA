Veeroute Packer API.  # Description  The service is designed to calculate the placement of goods inside specified packages.  ## Package types  ### Pallet  ![pallet](../images/packer_pallet.svg)  *Mono pallet*  If a pallet is fully equipped with the same product, then such a pallet is called mono-pallet, mono-pallet loading rules:  1. The maximum permissible height of the pallet with the goods laid on it: 1800 mm 1. Maximum permissible weight of the loaded pallet: 650 kg 1. Packages of goods may only be stacked parallel to the pallet walls. 1. It is allowed to rotate packages around the vertical Z axis and only at right angles. 1. To level the height between positions (for placing another pallet on top), empty spaces can be added to the stacking in layers.  *Zoned pallet*  After the formation of mono-pallets, the remaining part of the goods of the same article is placed on the next pallet, which is divided into zones by means of a cardboard partition in such a way that only one article is placed in each zone, the zones have the following restrictions:  1. Zones are rectangular. 1. The ratio between the sides of the zones can be any. 1. One side of any zone is always in contact with the edge of the pallet. 1. Allowable number of zones on a pallet: from 2 to 6. 1. Each zone is filled according to the rules for filling a mono-pallet. 1. The stacking height of all goods does not exceed 50 mm, so that another pallet can be placed on top of such a pallet. 1. It is allowed to form pallets with different stacking heights for different positions (the difference in heights is more than 50 mm), if these are the top pallets in a stack.  ### Mix box  ![mixbox](../images/packer_mixbox.svg)  If the steps above fail to place the item in this way, so that the pallet has the required height or weight, mix boxes are used:  1. Mix boxes can only be placed in one layer. 1. In one mix-box there can be different goods, in this case it is divided by partitions similarly to the pallet (the only difference is that the height of the packed goods is not aligned). 1. Mix boxes can be mixed with items on one pallet. 1. One product can be packed in different mix boxes.  ### Slot  ![slot](../images/packer_slot.svg)  Loaded pallets are stacked on top of each other, the slot is where the stack of pallets is placed. The slot has no physical body - so the dimensions of the &#x60;body&#x60; of the slot are zero.  ## Coordinate system  ![coordinates](../images/packer_coordinates.svg)  The local coordinate system is used to indicate the location of packages and goods, in which the coordinates of a particular object are indicated relative to the near-left lower corner of the parent object, while:  * Horizontal plane - **X**, **Y** axes * Vertical - **Z** axis  ## Entity relationship diagram  ![erd](../uml/packer.svg)
