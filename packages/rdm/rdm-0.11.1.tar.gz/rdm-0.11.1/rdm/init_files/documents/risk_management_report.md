TODO: This document is currently in-progress, and as such, it is not comprehensive. Note that it currently conflicts slightly with the risk-related activities in the software plan. These issues will be rectified in a future RDM update. For devices with hardware, risk-management is typically conducted at the system-level.

- Show how the risk management plan has been appropriately implemented.
- Demonstrate that the risk management file has been assessed by the appropriate personnel and the overall residual risk is acceptable
- Demonstrate appropriate methods are established for the collection and assessment of relevant production and post-production information

This document should also comply with the relevant parts of ISO 14971.
