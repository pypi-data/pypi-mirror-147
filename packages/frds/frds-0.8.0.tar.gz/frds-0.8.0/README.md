[frds](https://github.com/mgao6767/frds/) is an open-sourced Python package for computing [a collection of major academic measures](https://frds.io/measures/) used in the finance literature in a simple and straightforward way.

## Installation

### Install via `pip`

```bash
pip install frds -U
```

### Install from source

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/mgao6767/frds.git
```

Build and install the package locally.

``` bash
cd frds
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
pip install -e .
```

On Windows, [Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019) may need to be installed so that the C/C++ extensions in the package can be compiled. 

## Note

This library is still under development and breaking changes may be expected.

## Built-in measures

The primary purpose of `frds` is to offer ready-to-use functions used in researches.

For example, Kritzman, Li, Page, and Rigobon (2010) propose an [Absorption Ratio](https://frds.io/measures/absorption_ratio/) that measures the fraction of the total variance of a set of asset returns explained or absorbed by a fixed number of eigenvectors. It captures the extent to which markets are unified or tightly coupled.

``` python
>>> import numpy as np
>>> from frds.measures import absorption_ratio
>>> data = np.array( # Hypothetical 6 daily returns of 3 assets.
...             [
...                 [0.015, 0.031, 0.007, 0.034, 0.014, 0.011],
...                 [0.012, 0.063, 0.027, 0.023, 0.073, 0.055],
...                 [0.072, 0.043, 0.097, 0.078, 0.036, 0.083],
...             ]
...         )
>>> absorption_ratio(data, fraction_eigenvectors=0.2)
0.7746543307660252
```

Another example, [Distress Insurance Premium (DIP)](https://frds.io/measures/distress_insurance_premium/) proposed by Huang, Zhou, and Zhu (2009) as a systemic risk measure of a hypothetical insurance premium against a systemic financial distress, defined as total losses that exceed a given threshold, say 15%, of total bank liabilities.

``` python
>>> from frds.measures import distress_insurance_premium
>>> # hypothetical implied default probabilities of 6 banks
>>> default_probabilities = np.array([0.02, 0.10, 0.03, 0.20, 0.50, 0.15] 
>>> correlations = np.array(
...     [
...         [ 1.000, -0.126, -0.637, 0.174,  0.469,  0.283],
...         [-0.126,  1.000,  0.294, 0.674,  0.150,  0.053],
...         [-0.637,  0.294,  1.000, 0.073, -0.658, -0.085],
...         [ 0.174,  0.674,  0.073, 1.000,  0.248,  0.508],
...         [ 0.469,  0.150, -0.658, 0.248,  1.000, -0.370],
...         [ 0.283,  0.053, -0.085, 0.508, -0.370,  1.000],
...     ]
... )
>>> distress_insurance_premium(default_probabilities, correlations)       
0.28661995758
```

## Data source integration

Additionally, `frds` provides an interface to load data from common data sources such as

- [Wharton Research Data Services (WRDS)](https://wrds-web.wharton.upenn.edu/wrds/)
- [Refinitiv Tick History (formerly Thomson Reuters Tick History)](https://www.refinitiv.com/en/market-data/data-feeds/tick-history)
- more to come...

### WRDS

As an example, let's say we want to download the Compustat Fundamentals Annual dataset.

``` python
>>> from frds.data.wrds.comp import Funda
>>> from frds.io.wrds import load
>>> FUNDA = load(Funda, use_cache=True, obs=100)
>>> FUNDA.data.head()

       1964-12-31 00:00:00.000000  1964.0   INDL      C      D     STD  AE.2  000032102  A & E PLASTIK PAK INC  ...    NaN  3.089999  NaN  None  None    None  None  None

[5 rows x 946 columns]
```

We can then compute some measures on the go:

``` python
>>> tangibility = FUNDA.PPENT / FUNDA.AT
>>> type(tangibility)
<class 'pandas.core.series.Series'>
>>> tangibility.sample(10).sort_index()
GVKEY   DATADATE
001000  1965-12-31 00:00:00.000000    0.604762

        1968-12-31 00:00:00.000000    0.654171
        1977-12-31 00:00:00.000000    0.452402
001001  1985-12-31 00:00:00.000000    0.567439
001003  1980-12-31 00:00:00.000000         NaN
        1988-01-31 00:00:00.000000    0.073495
001004  1967-05-31 00:00:00.000000    0.175518
        1980-05-31 00:00:00.000000    0.183682
        1982-05-31 00:00:00.000000    0.286231
