# FairRecKitLib
FairRecKitLib is a library that functions as a combinatory interface between a set of existing recommender libraries, such as [Lenskit](https://github.com/lenskit/lenskit), [Implicit](https://github.com/benfred/implicit), and [Elliot](https://github.com/sisinflab/elliot). It was made to accompany the [FairRecKit application](https://github.com/TheMinefreak23/fair-rec-kit-app).

This program has been developed by students from the bachelor Computer Science at
Utrecht University within the Software Project course.
