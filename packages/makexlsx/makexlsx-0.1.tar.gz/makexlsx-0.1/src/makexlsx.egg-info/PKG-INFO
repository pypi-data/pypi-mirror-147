         makexlsx -- make XLSX spreadsheet from tabular data files
        ===========================================================
        
        Do you often import CSV files to Excel, and find yourself doing the same
        mouse-clicky nonsense every time to make it look nice?  Would you like all
        that fiddling with column widths, autofiltering, text wrapping and
        centering to just happen by magic?  Yes, so would I.  Which is why I wrote
        this:
        
        * It takes one or more tabular data files (not just CSV, but any format
          that tablib_ will accept) and produces an XLSX workbook with one table
          per sheet.
        
        * If a table header is present, it's made bold, the header line is frozen,
          and autofiltering is applied to all the columns.
        
        * Wrapping is applied to any columns that have line breaks in their values,
          or lines beyond a certain (user-defined) length.
        
        * All numeric columns are right-justified.  Non-numeric columns are centred
          if their width is below a certain (user-defined) size, otherwise they are
          left-justified.
        
        * It uses the amazing xlsxwriter_ package to do all the output.
