# Overview
Datapanels is an application for displaying a rotating set of independent panels, each of which displays
some useful or entertaining information or something visually interesting. 

# Usage
After installation, the application can be run using

```
python -m datapanels.app [--builder_path path_to_builder_file] [--transition-sec secs] [--full_screen]
```

The --builder_path option lets you specify a configuration file that will 
determine what panels get displayed. The --transition-sec parameter lets 
you specify the number of seconds between transitions. If no parameters are
provided, a simple default set of panels will be created.

## Configuring DataPanels

DataPanels can be configured via a configuration file that specifies 
what panels should be displayed.  This is actually a Kivy ([https://kivy.org/]) 
configuration file.  

The configuration file should take the form:

```
<DataBuilder>:
    PanelType1:
        panel type one parameters
    PanelType2
        panel type two parameters
    PanelType2
        parameters for another instance of PanelType2
```

The following example show a sample configuration.  

```
<DataBuilder>:
    border: 0
    QuotationDisplay:
        update_sec: 5
        quotations: "See https://github.com/man-vs-electron/datapanels for info on how to configure this application.", "Where you go, that's where you'll be", "Thanks for trying this application."
    StockPanel:
        tickers: 'MSFT', 'PSEC', 'TSLA'
        data_update_rate_sec: 60*20
        ticker_change_rate_sec: 5
    GameOfLifePanel:
        update_rate: 0.5
        activated_color: 1, 0, 0, 1
        grid_color: 0, 0, 1, 1

```

# Panel Types

Each panel displayed in Datapanels can be configured.  The following
sections describe each panel type and its key parameters.

## QuotationDisplay
The quotation display is a simple panel that displays quotations.  These
quotations change periodically.

The parameters include:
* __update_sec__: The number of seconds before changing the quotation
* __quotations__: assigned as either a list of strings, one per quotation, or a single string that is a path to
  a file with quotations, one per line.

## StockPanel
The StockPanel display information about a list of stocks.  Data about
one stock is shown at a time and the specific stock shown is rotated
around on a regular basis.

The parameters include:
* __data_update_rate_sec__: how many seconds between updating the stock info
* __proxserver__: if not None, a proxy server to use for talking to yfinance
* __ticker_change_rate_sec__: how many seconds between changing the stock being shown
* __tickers__: list of security ticker symbols to track

## GameOfLifePanel
The Kivy panel that displays the Game of Life, along with some controls.

Key Properties:
* __update_rate__: number of seconds between each generation
* __random_cell_count__: Either percentage of cells to make alive or the number of cells to make alive when randomizing.
* __background_color__ - RGBA list for the inactive cell color
* __grid_color__ - RGBA for the grid lines
* __activated_color__ - RGBA for the active cell color
* __cell_length__ - the length of the side of a cell (essentially cell size)

## WeatherPanel
The Kivy panel that displays current weather and weather forecast for a list of provided locations.  

This panel uses information downloaded from https://openweathermap.org and requires a key.  The free key 
is sufficient for the data that is used in this panel.  When configuring the panel, the key can either be
places in the configuation key using the owm_key option or an environment variable owm_key can be set.

Key Properties:
* __owm_key__ - The user's key from https://openweathermap.org/.  IMPORTANT: This panel will not work without this key.*
    It either needs to be specified as a property in the configuration or it needs to be set as an
    environment variable.  You can get a free key by registering at openweathermap.org.
* __temp_units__ - either fahrenheit or celcius (Default - fahrenheit)
* __text_color__ - the rgba color of the text and line components of the interface. (Default - [0,0,0,1])
* __bg_color__ - the background color (Default - [.5, .5, .5, 1])
* __data_update_rate_sec__ - The number of seconds between data updates
* __location_switch_rate_sec__ - The number of seconds to show each location

* __locations__ - a list of WeatherResponse objects, one each for the locations of interest.  This attribute can be
    set by assigning a list in the form of [(lat1, lon1), location_name1, (lat2, lon2), location_name2, ...].
    This is the form to use when assigning locations using the configuration file.  If assigned this way, 
    it will be converted in a list of WeatherResponse objects.
