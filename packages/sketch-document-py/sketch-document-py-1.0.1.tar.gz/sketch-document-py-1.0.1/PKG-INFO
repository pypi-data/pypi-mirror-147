# `.sketch` document for python

[Sketch](https://sketch.com) stores documents in `.sketch` format, a zipped
archive of JSON formatted data and binary data such as images.

Inspired by [sketch-hq/sketch-document](https://github.com/sketch-hq/sketch-document)

## Sketch file format schemas and APIs.

This project contains the APIs to work with Sketch
documents and document elements in Python dataclass.

- `sketch-file-format-py`: Python dataclass type hint to strongly type objects
  representing Sketch documents, or fragments of Sketch documents in TypeScript
  projects.
- `sketch-file`: Python APIs to read and write `.sketch` files.

## Development

To build this project, you need install Python build dependency management tool [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), to install Poetry , follow [Poetry installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)

To install nessasary deps and CLI tools, including a task runner [Poe the Poet](https://github.com/nat-n/poethepoet)(CLI executable named `poe`) that work with Poetry, run command:
```shell
poetry install
```

To generate Sketch Dataclass type file, which is nessasary for build or install development, run command:
```shell
poe gen_types
```



For further usages of Poetry, check [Poetry Documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs)
