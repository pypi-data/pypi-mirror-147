"""Base Model for all Pygasus stored objects.

All data models destined to be stored in Pygasus should inherit,
directly or indirectly, from the `Model` class defined here.
Models are described using simple type annotation
and inherit from Pydantic `BaseModel`, so they share the features
of models defined in Pydantic.

```python
from typing import Optional

grom pygasus import Model

class User(Model):

    '''A User model.'''

    id: int
    name: str
    age: int
    gender: Optional[str]
```

Behind the scenes, a Pygasus model is meant to be light and mostly
independent from the storage utility.  It is linked to a repository,
which is defined bvy default (but you can easily override it).
This repository has access to the storage utility and can perform
more advanced queries.  For convenience's sake, the `__setattr__` method
of models is linked to the UPDATE operation on the repository, so that
modifying a model will update it in storage as well.  This is the only
convenience (creating a model as usual with `__init__` won't do
anything in regard to the storage).  Of course, you can still access
the repository and perform these operations:

```python
# This will perform an INSERT operation on the user repository.
new_user = User.repository.create(name="Vincent", age=33)
# At this point, the new user has an ID which is set by the storage utility.
print(new_user.id)
# And this will perform an UPDATE operation.
new_user.age = 21
# This will fetch the user with id of 5.
user_5 = User.repository.get(id=5)
```
