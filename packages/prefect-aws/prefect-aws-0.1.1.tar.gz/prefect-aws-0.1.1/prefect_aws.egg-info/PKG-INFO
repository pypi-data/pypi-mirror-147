# prefect-aws

## Welcome!

`prefect-aws` is a collection of pre-built Prefect tasks that can be used to quickly construct Prefect flows that interact with Amazon Web Services.

## Getting Started

### Python setup

Requires an installation of Python 3.7+

We recommend using a Python virtual environment manager such as pipenv, conda or virtualenv.

These tasks are designed to work with Prefect 2.0. For more information about how to use Prefect, please refer to the [Prefect documentation](https://orion-docs.prefect.io/).

### Installation

Install `prefect-aws`

```bash
pip install prefect-aws
```

### AWS Authentication

You will need to obtain AWS credentials in order to use these tasks. Refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html) for authentication methods available.

### Write and run a flow

```python
from prefect import flow
from prefect_aws import s3_upload

@flow
def example_s3_upload_flow():
    aws_credentials = AwsCredentials(
        aws_access_key_id="acccess_key_id",
        aws_secret_access_key="secret_access_key"
    )
    with open("data.csv", "rb") as file:
        key = s3_upload(
            bucket="bucket",
            key="data.csv",
            data=file.read(),
            aws_credentials=aws_credentials,
        )

example_s3_upload_flow()
```
