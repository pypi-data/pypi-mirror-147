Installing Pbindex
------------------

The easiest way to install ``pbindex`` is described in `PacBio & Bioconda`_.
One way to do that and make the result usable by |project| would be to follow
the instructions to install ``pbbioconda`` (as described in
`PacBio & Bioconda`_) and pass the path to the ``pbindex`` executable to
``sm-analysis`` if needed.
