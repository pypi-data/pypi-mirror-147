# 2. Package
This package is designed to calculate the value of lives lost due to Covid-19 and to determine how much damage the country has suffered in terms of GNI ratio.<br>
To calculate the value of a life, we use an index called VSL. This index stands for value of statistical life, and represents the value of a human life. Using this VSL data and the number of deaths due to Covid-19, we can calculate the value of lives lost due to Covid-19.<br>
The following indicators are used in this package.<br>
deaths<br>
VSL ($/million)<br>
GNI ($/thousand)<br>
Population(/100000)<br>
eloss_total(VSL * deaths)<br>
GNI_total(GNI * Population)<br>
eDamage_per_GNI(eloss_total/GNI_total)<br>
# 3. How to rum?
You can use this package easily.<br>

$ pip install lostlifevalue<br>
Next, run this command.<br>
$ lostlifevalue<br>
When you run the above command, you will be asked a question like the one in the image.<br>
