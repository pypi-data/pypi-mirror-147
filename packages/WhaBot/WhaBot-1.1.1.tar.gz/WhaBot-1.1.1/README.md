## üßê About <a name = "About"></a>
WhaBot is a framework that automates all the tasks that a human can do on WhatsApp! 

It's created to _(somehow)_ create powerfull bots in this platform, as we can do in others as Discord, Slack, Telegram, etc.

## üèÅ Getting Things Ready <a name = "Starting"></a>
If you follow this easy step by step guide, you will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

```bash
# Python 3.6+ required
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

pip install -U pip
pip install WhaBot
```

Also, the Core of this framework is Selenium, that's why you need to download a chromedriver binary that works with your chromium based browser and matches the correct version. You can find more information about this steup [here](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/getting-started#h.p_ID_36).

### Prerequisites
For you to create a functional bot, you will need a WhatsApp account. We recommend a WhatsApp Bussiness account and a phone number just dedicated to run the bot.

### Running it
After installing the framework via pip and downloading the correct chromedriver, we are ready to go!


Here is an example code to create a simple bot!

```python
import WhaBot

WhaBot = WhaBot(reloaded=False)

chat = "Myself" # Change this to a contact from your contact lists! (This also works with phone numbers or groups!)

WhaBot.SendMessage(chat=chat, message="Hello!\nWe are up and running!!")
```
Once you have that done, here you have an actual bot, with 2 commands!

```python
import time
import WhaBot

WhaBot = WhaBot(reloaded=False)

def HandleCommands(ctx):
	for contact in ctx:
		if WhaBot.CommandHandler(ctx=contact, command="!ping"):
			message = "Pong!\nWe are working fine!"
			WhaBot.SendMessage(chat=contact["Chat_Name"], message=message)

		elif WhaBot.CommandHandler(ctx=contact, command="!help"):
			message = f"Hey @{contact['Chat_Name']}!\nWe are still working in this option!\n\nStay tune for new updates!"
			WhaBot.SendMessage(chat=contact["Chat_Name"], message=message)

while __name__ == '__main__':
	unreads = SendMessage.GetUnreadChats(scrolls=10)
	HandleCommands(ctx=unreads)
	time.sleep(0.5)
```
That's it! You now have your first bot up and running, listening for 2 commands: `!ping` and `!help`, try them!!
