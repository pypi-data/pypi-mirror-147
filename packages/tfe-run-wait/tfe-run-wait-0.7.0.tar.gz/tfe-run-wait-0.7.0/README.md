## Description
Finds a Terraform Enterpise run initiated for the specified git commit and either polls for a
specific state change or apply the planned changes.

tfe-run-wait will wait until the specified status is reached. By default it will wait for
the status `applied` or `planned_and_finished`. When the run reaches a non specified final state,
it will exit with an error.

tfe-run-apply will request terraform to apply to plan for the run. If the status of the run is
already `applied` or `planned_and_finished`, it will exit without an error. It will not check
whether the run is in the correct state. Depending on the configuration the run should be in
the state `planned`, `cost_estimated` or `policy_checked`.

If no workspace is specified, you have to specify a branch; the utility will search for
all workspaces associated with the specified source repository and branch.

## CAVEATS
- the wait and apply is single threaded.
