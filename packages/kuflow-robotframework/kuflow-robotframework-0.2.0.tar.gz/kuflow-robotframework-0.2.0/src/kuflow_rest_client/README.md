# Instructions


The kuflow_rest_client code is generate from the 'openapi-generator-cli' tool. This tool is configured as script in node, so if
you want to generate the code, you must have a Node (>=v16.13) in your system.

As the generation tool requires Java, you also need to have a Java virtual machine installed. For the current version of the
generation tool, Java version 11 is required. Other versions, such as 17, fail.

`npm run generate`
