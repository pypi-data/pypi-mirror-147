[TODO]
* Freshen up the examples folder, do a new example based on the login page where
    clicking somewhere spawns further pages, and destroys spawned pages.

* Use the Pop Up warnings in a demo and see what their viability is.

[ChangeLog]
4.6.22-Ruckusist v0.0.3: added the demo_mode flag to the App Object to turn off
    the About and Fire functionality. This gives me the idea to put more demo 
    stuff there. I want to copy cmatrix, dropping snowflakes, video player, other 
    stuff.
