### General-Usage ⬇

Like any other 3rd party module you can easily import the desired **sub-module** by specifying what you want from the main rovlib module

```python
from rovlib.cameras import RovCam
# or
from rovlib.control import RovMavLink, Mode
```

**-- brief description 📝**
The camera module is required to receive frames from ROV cameras being sent by the [On board camera system](https://github.com/RobEn-AAST/ROV-camsys)

It is a python sub-module that simplifies the use of [pymavlink](https://mavlink.io/en/mavgen_python/) APIs, to ease the control of our beloved Alenda (the ROV).

## Establish communication 🤝

```python
# create an instance of RovMavlink
# Those are the default constructor params.
rov = RovMavlink(connection_type = 'udpin', connection_ip = '0.0.0.0', connection_port = '14550', silent_mode = True)
# Binds to the port in the given address
rov.establish_connection()
```

To start controlling the **vehicle you should Arm it first**. To arm it use there following commands.

```python
# Silent mode is used to shut off prints from the used functions for instance - > 'vehicle Armed successfully'
rov = RovMavlink(silent_mode=False).establish_connection()
rov.arm_vehicle() # you only need to arm the vehicle once, there is no need to arm it every time you want to stablize it

# to disarm vehicle
rov.disarm_vehicle()
```

## Set vehicle mode 🎯

```python
rov = RovMavlink().establish_connection()
rov.arm_vehicle()
rov.set_vehicle_mode(Mode.STABILIZE)
```

Those are all the modes you would need to use. If you used **_set_vehicle_mode()_** with any thing other that Mode enum it would raise a violation ❌🔞. blash fakaka 😘

```python
class Mode(IntEnum):
    STABILIZE = 0
    ACRO = 1
    ALT_HOLD = 2
    AUTO = 3
    GUIDED = 4
    CIRCLE = 7
    SURFACE = 9
    POSHOLD = 16
    MANUAL = 19

# use them as follows
# rov.set_vehicle_mode(Mode.STABILIZE)

```

## sending custom control 🎮

### ⚠ Take care the throttle of x, y, z and rotation is a value between **_-1 to 1_**. any value out side this boundry will raise a violation. ❌🔞

```python
rov.send_control(JoyStickControl(x_throttle = 0.5, y_throttle = 0.5, z_throttle = 0, rotation_throttle = 1, delay = 0.1))
```

also you can it as follows ⬇

```python
rov = RovMavlink(silent_mode=False).establish_connection()
period = 10 # period for moving the joystick control in seconds
rov.arm_vehicle()
# my_lovely_fake_joy_stick = JoyStickControl(x_throttle=1, y_throttle=1) # name the param u want to add and give it a value between -1 to 1
my_lovely_fake_joy_stick = JoyStickControl(y_throttle=1)
rov.send_control(my_lovely_fake_joy_stick, period)
```
