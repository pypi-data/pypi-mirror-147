### BetterDesign
## Purpose
BetterDesign is a simple python module to make styling command line applications easier.
## Updates and new features
If I ever update this, it will be uncommon since I only made this when I was bored. I do plan to eventually add some stuff with colors, feel free to submit a pull request if you add anything!
## Credits
This was solely developed by <a href="https://github.com/c0nvict">c0nvict</a>, this isn't supposed to be a huge project, just some things to make your application nicer
