### BetterDesign
## Purpose
BetterDesign is a simple python module to make styling command line applications easier.
## Updates and new features
If I ever update this, it will be uncommon since I only made this when I was bored. I do plan to eventually add some stuff with colors, feel free to submit a pull request if you add anything!
