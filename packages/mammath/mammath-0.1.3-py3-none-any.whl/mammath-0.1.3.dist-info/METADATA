Mammath is the python library with all the functions you need to do complicated mathematics (e.g logarithms, integrals, and more).

It is built upon several other modules including sys, tkinter, string, time, math, cmath, fractions, mpmath, keyboard, numpy, sympy, tabulate, re, matplotlib, and modules within them.
