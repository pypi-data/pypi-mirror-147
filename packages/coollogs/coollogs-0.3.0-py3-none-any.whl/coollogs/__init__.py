This module is made for more verbouse and eye-catching printing of
information to console.

Example:
    Here is simple example that shows, how to implement basic logging:

        $ from coollogs import log
        $ log.info("That's it!")

Attributes:
    log (Logger): Initialized ``Logger`` object with default arguments,
        that is easy to import and ready to usage.

Todo:
    * Save output to file
    * Deal somehow with super-long arguments
    * Provide more information on logging, with different block prefixes
