"""
Principles of implementing scheduler:
- clicking on "Run" for a job should cause no delay

- there should be a sensible and clear priority structure over
  which actions are possible when a job is in various statuses
  (e.g. it should not be possible to run a job when it is in
  the process of being spawned, or is already running)
- the above principle should extend to such rules as: if users
  click "Run" for the same job in quick succession, it should
  only run once

- there should be sensible logic for trying to assign a job
  to a host, and how to retry running the job if no appropriate
  host is available first time (and this should be non-blocking,
  it shouldn't block scheduler's core processing loop, however
  that is implemented

- logic around resetting and rescheduling jobs should be clear
  (e.g. if we want to have a job with multiple schedules)

- ideally all actions should be easily trackable, so for example
  when we click on "Run", we might receive a 200 indicating that
  the job was added to the queue successfully, but it would be
  nice to be able to track its progress through the various stages
  of spawn/run somehow (maybe this isn't necessary since all jobs
  have statuses now, these statuses are clearly visible)

          A name for the scheduler object. If you only use one

          This name is used to differentiate between Scheduler
          objects, in particular it is used as the folder where
          logs for the jobs are stored. This means that when

          A list containing the delays (in seconds) to use when
          retrying spawning a job, due to not finding a suitable

          10, then 20, then 60 seconds, simply pass in a list
          [10, 20, 60]. To not implement any sort of retry logic,
