# Django Prose

![PyPI - Downloads](https://img.shields.io/pypi/dw/django-prose?color=purple) ![PyPI - Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/django-prose)

Django Prose provides your Django applications with wonderful rich-text editing.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6.2 or later
- Django 2.2 or later
- Bleach 4.0 or later

## Getting started

To get started with Django Prose, first make sure to install it. We use and suggest using Poetry, although Pipenv and pip will work seamlessly as well

```console
poetry add django-prose
```

Then, add `prose` in Django's installed apps (example: [`prose_example/prose_example/settings.py`](https://github.com/withlogicco/django-prose/blob/55fb9319e55d873afe43968817a2f5ea3f055d11/prose_example/prose_example/settings.py#L46)):

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # Django stock apps (e.g. 'django.contrib.admin')

    'prose',

    # your application's apps
]
```

Last, run migrations so you can use Django Prose's Document model:

```
python manage.py migrate prose
```

Now, you are ready to go üöÄ.

## Usage

There are different ways to use Django prose according to your needs. We will examine all of them here.

### Small rich-text information

You might want to add rich-text information in a model that is just a few characters (e.g. 140), like an excerpt from an article. In that case we suggest using the `RichTextField`. Example:

```py
from django.db import models
from prose.fields import RichTextField

class Article(models.Model):
    excerpt = RichTextField()
```

Then you can display the article excerpt in your HTML templates by marking it as [`safe`](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/ref/templates/builtins/#safe)

```django
<div class="article-excerpt">{{ article.excerpt | safe}}</div>
```

### Large rich-text information

In case you want to store large rich-text information, like the content of an article, which can span to quite a few thousand characters, we suggest you use the `AbstractDocument` model. This will save large rich-text information in a separate database table, which is better for performance. Example:

```py
from django.db import models
from prose.fields import RichTextField
from prose.models import AbstractDocument

class ArticleContent(AbstractDocument):
    pass

class Article(models.Model):
    excerpt = RichTextField()
    body = models.OneToOneField(ArticleContent, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
```

Similarly here you can display the article's body by marking it as `safe`

```django
<div class="article-body">{{ article.body.content | safe}}</div>
```

### Attachments

Django Prose can also handle uploading attachments with drag and drop. To set this up, first you need to:

- [x] Set up the `MEDIA_ROOT` of your Django project (example in [`prose_example/prose_example/settings.py`](https://github.com/withlogicco/django-prose/blob/55fb9319e55d873afe43968817a2f5ea3f055d11/prose_example/prose_example/settings.py#L132)))
- [x] Include the Django Prose URLs (example in [`prose_example/prose_example/urls.py`](https://github.com/withlogicco/django-prose/blob/9073d713f8d3febe5c50705976dbb31063270886/prose_example/prose_example/urls.py#L9-L10))
- [x] (Optional) Set up a different Django storage to store your files (e.g. S3)

## üîí A note on security

As you can see in the examples above, what Django Prose does is provide you with a user friendly editor ([Trix](https://trix-editor.org/)) for your rich text content and then store it as HTML in your database. Since you will mark this HTML as safe in order to use it in your templates, it needs to be **sanitised**, before it gets stored in the database.

For this reason Django Prose is using [Bleach](https://bleach.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to only allow the following tags and attributes:

- **Allowed tags**: `p`, `ul`, `ol`, `li`, `strong`, `em`, `div`, `span`, `a`, `blockquote`, `pre`, `figure`, `figcaption`, `br`, `code`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`, `h4`, `h5`, `h6`, `picture`, `source`, `img`
- **Allowed attributes**: `alt`, `class`, `id`, `src`, `srcset`, `href`, `media`
