Python Durand - CANopen Device Library
=======================================

CANopen library to implement (local) nodes.

Hmmm..., but wait! There is already a CANopen library out there: python-canopen_.
Why starting a new library? python-canopen is the library to choose, if you
want to control remote nodes. It's possible to implement local nodes with
python-canopen, but (IMHO) it's not the main target. *Durand* has a focus on this
part.

Backends:

- CAN interfaces via python-can_
- `Network` objects from python-canopen_
