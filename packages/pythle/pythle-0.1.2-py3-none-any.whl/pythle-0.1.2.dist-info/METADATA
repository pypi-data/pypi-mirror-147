## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

**A terminal with support for [ANSI colours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code#Colors) is required.**

Before you go any further, [ensure you have Python and that the expected version is available from your command line](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/#ensure-you-can-run-python-from-the-command-line).

If you do not have Python, please install the latest 3.x version from [python.org](https://www.python.org/) or refer to the [Installing Python](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/installation/#installation) section of the Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python.

### Installation

To learn how to install a Python file (package), refer to the [Installation Tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/installing-packages/) from PyPI.

Install using pip:

```
pip install pythle
```

## Play

To start the game, run from the command line:

```
pythle
```

Type your guess and hit the enter button to submit.
