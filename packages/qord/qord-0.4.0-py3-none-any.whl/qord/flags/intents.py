class Intents(Flags):
    """:class:`Flags` subclass that details the gateway intents.

    Gateway intents allow you to toggle specific gateway events if whether
    you want to receive them or not. This also affects the caching for relevant
    entity. Gateway intents are useful to disable events that you don't need for
    your bot and decrease the workload. For example, if your bot doesn't need
    direct messages events, you can set :attr:`.direct_messages` to ``False``.

    Some intents are marked as privileged. These intents are required to be
    enabled explicitly from the bot's application page on Discord Developers Portal.
    If the bot is in more then 100 servers, These intents require verification
    and whitelisting.

    Attempting to enable these intents without enabling them from Developers Portal
    will cause the bot to terminate with :exc:`MissingPrivilegedIntents` error.

    Current privileged intents are:

    - :attr:`.members`
    - :attr:`.presences`
    - :attr:`.message_content`
