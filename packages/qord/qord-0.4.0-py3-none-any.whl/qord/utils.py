    Parameters
    ----------
    time: Optional[Union[:class:`datetime.datetime`, :class:`builtins.int`, :class:`builtins.float`]]
        The timestamp to use. If not given, The result of :meth:`datetime.datetime.now` is used.
        If a datetime object is given, The epoch timestamp would be extracted from it. If
        a float is given, It would be rounded of.
    style: :class:`builtins.str`
        The style for the timestamp. If not provided, The default style
        is used, See :class:`TimestampStyle` for all possible values.

        .. note::
            This parameter is not validated by the library in case Discord
            adds a new style. You should consider validating it yourself.

    -------
    :class:`builtins.str`
        The created timestamp in proper format.
