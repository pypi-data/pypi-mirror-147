    A guild member is simply a user that is part of a specific :class:`Guild`.
    Every guild member has an underlying :class:`User` object attached to it.

    .. note::
        This class provides shorthand properties to access the underlying user's
        data however certain properties like :attr:`.name` and :attr:`.avatar`
        have different behaviour in this class.

        For example, :attr:`.avatar` and other avatar related methods and attributes
        also consider the guild specific avatar of member for relevant functionality
        with addition to user's global avatar.

    Attributes
    ----------
    guild: :class:`Guild`
        The parent guild that this member belongs to.
    user: :class:`User`
        The user associated to this member.
    nickname: Optional[:class:`builtins.str`]
        The nickname of this member in the guild. If member has no guild
        specific nickname set, This is ``None``. See :attr:`.display_name` property
        that aids in retrieving the name more efficiently.
    guild_avatar: Optional[:class:`builtins.str`]
        The hash of avatar for this member in the guild. If member has no
        guild specific avatar set, This is ``None``. See :attr:`.display_avatar` property
        that aids in retrieving the avatar more efficiently.
    deaf: :class:`builtins.bool`
        Whether the member is deafened in voice channels.
    mute: :class:`builtins.bool`
        Whether the member is muted in voice channels.
    pending: :class:`builtins.bool`
        Whether the member has passed the membership screening.
    joined_at: :class:`datetime.datetime`
        The time when member joined the guild.
    premium_since: Optional[:class:`datetime.datetime`]
        The time when member started boosting the guild if applicable. If member
        is not boosting the guild, This is ``None``.
    timeout_until: Optional[:class:`datetime.datetime`]
        The time until which member is timed out and cannot interact with
        the guild. If member is not timed out, This is ``None``.

        .. note::
            This attribute may have a value set even if member is not actually
            timed out. In which case, The datetime object would be in past. See
            :meth:`.is_timed_out` check that covers all possible cases.

    role_ids: List[:class:`builtins.int`]
        The list of IDs of roles that are associated to this member.
    roles: List[:class:`Role`]
        The list of roles associated to this member.

        """Adds the provided roles to the members.

        The behaviour of this method is summarized as:

        - The default behaviour is, roles to add are passed as positional \
          arguments and they are added to the user without overwriting \
          the previous roles.

        - When ``overwrite`` keyword parameter is set to ``True``, The provided \
          roles will be bulkly added and previous roles of the member would be overwritten. \
          This is equivalent to ``roles`` parameter in :meth:`.edit`.

        - When ``ignore_extra`` is ``False``, Will always attempt to add the role regardless \
          of whether the role already exists on the member. This would cause unnecessary API calls.

        - Returns the list of roles that were added to the member.

        Parameters
        ----------
        *roles: :class:`Role`
            The roles to add, passed as positional arguments.
        overwrite: :class:`builtins.bool`
            Whether to overwrite existing roles with new ones.
        ignore_extra: :class:`builtins.bool`
            Whether to ignore extra roles that already exist on members. Defaults to ``True``.
        reason: :class:`builtins.str`
            The reason for performing this action.

        Returns
        -------
        List[:class:`Role`]
            The list of added roles. This only includes roles that were actually
            added and not the ones that were provided but weren't added because they
            already exist on member.
