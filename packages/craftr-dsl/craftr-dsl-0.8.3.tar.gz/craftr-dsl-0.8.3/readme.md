# craftr-dsl

A domain specific language purpose-built for the Craftr build system.

The Craftr DSL is an "almost superset" of Python 3; adding a lot of syntactical features that make it more
convenient to describe build configurations at the cost of some other syntax features of the native Python
language (like set literals).

## Installation

    $ pip install craftr-dsl

The `craftr-dsl` package requires at least Python 3.8.
