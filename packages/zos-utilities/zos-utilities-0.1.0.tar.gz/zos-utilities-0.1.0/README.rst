Library for performing various utility functions needed for z/OS libraries.  Right now, this just means "Julian"
date conversion.  But I have a couple of libraries that do various things for/with z/OS, and they all need
to convert from the z/OS Julian Date to datetime, so I thought I might as well put it into a library.
