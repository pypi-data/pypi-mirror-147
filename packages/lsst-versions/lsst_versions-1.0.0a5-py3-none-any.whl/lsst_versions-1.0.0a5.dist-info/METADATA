lsst_versions
=============

This package is used to calculate a version dynamically from a Git repository when it is being built by ``pip``.
It is not needed for EUPS-only packages, and the calculated package version will be ``pip``-compatible and thus differ from that produced by EUPS's ``pkgautoversion``.
It avoids the need to hard-code and continually update a version string.
It assumes the use of LSST DM release and tagging practices.
