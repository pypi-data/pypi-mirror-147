## Setup
DaLI has been tested on Ubuntu Linux, macOS and Windows 10 but it should work on all systems that have Python version 3.7.0 or greater. Virtualenv is recommended for DaLI development.

### Setup on Ubuntu Linux
First make sure Python, pip and virtualenv are installed. If not, open a terminal window and enter the following commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python3 python3-pip virtualenv
```

Then install DaLI Python package requirements:
```
cd <rp2_directory>
virtualenv -p python3 .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
.venv/bin/pip3 install -e '.[dev]'
```
### Setup on macOS
First make sure [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) is installed, then open a terminal window and enter the following commands:
```
brew update
brew install python3 virtualenv
```

Then install DaLI Python package requirements:
```
cd <rp2_directory>
virtualenv -p python3 .venv
. .venv/bin/activate
.venv/bin/pip3 install -e '.[dev]'
```
### Setup on Windows 10
First make sure [Python](https://python.org) 3.7 or greater is installed (in the Python installer window be sure to click on "Add Python to PATH"), then open a PowerShell window and enter the following commands:
```
python -m pip install virtualenv
```

Then install DaLI Python package requirements:
```
cd <rp2_directory>
virtualenv -p python .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate.ps1
python -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```
### Setup on Other Unix-like Systems
* install python 3.7 or greater
* install pip3
* install virtualenv
* cd _<dali_directory>_
* `virtualenv -p python3 .venv`
* `.venv/bin/pip3 install -e '.[dev]'`

## Development
Read the [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) document on pull requests guidelines.

### Design Guidelines
DaLI code adheres to these principles:
* immutability: generally data structures are read-only (the only exceptions are for data structures that would incur a major complexity increase without write permission: e.g. AVL tree node).
  * class fields are private (prepended with double-underscore). Fields that need public access have a read-only property. Write-properties are not used;
  * @dataclass classes have `frozen=True`
* runtime checks: parameters of public functions are type-checked at runtime
* type hints: all variables and functions have Python type hints;
* no id-based hashing: classes that are added to dictionaries and sets redefine `__eq__()`, `__neq__()` and `__hash__()`;
* encapsulated math: all high-precision math is done via `RP2Decimal` (a subclass of Decimal), to ensure the correct precision is used throughout the code. `RP2Decimal` instances are never mixed with other types in expressions;
* f-strings only: every time string interpolation is needed, f-strings are used;
* logging: logging is done via the `logger` module;
* no unnamed tuples: dataclasses or named tuples are used instead;
* one class per file (with exceptions for trivial classes);
* files containing a class must have the same name as the class (but lowercase with underscores): e.g. class AbstractEntry lives in file abstract_entry.py;
* abstract classes' name starts with `Abstract`
* no imports with `*`.

### Development Workflow
DaLI uses pre-commit hooks for quick validation at commit time and continuous integration via Github actions for deeper testing. Pre-commit hooks invoke: flake8, black, isort, pyupgrade and more. Github actions invoke: mypy, pylint, bandit, unit tests (on Linux, Mac and Windows), markdown link check and more.

While every commit and push are automatically tested as described, sometimes it's useful to run some of the above commands locally without waiting for continuous integration. Here's how to run the most common ones:
* run unit tests: `pytest --tb=native --verbose`
* type check: `mypy src tests`
* lint: `pylint -r y src tests/*.py`
* security check: `bandit -r src`
* reformat code: `black src tests`
* sort imports: `isort .`
* run pre-commit tests without committing: `pre-commit run --all-files`

Logs are stored in the `log` directory. To generate debug logs, prepend the command line with `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`, e.g.:
```
LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG bin/dali -s -o output/ config/test_config.ini
```

### Unit Tests
Unit tests are in the [tests](tests) directory. Please add unit tests for any new code.

## Internal Design
DaLI's control flow is as follows (see [dali_main.py](src/dali/dali_main.py)):
* parse the INI configuration file which includes data loader plugin initialization parameters and global configuration sections;
* discover and instantiate data loader plugins using the initialization parameters from the config file and call their load() method, which reads data from native sources (CSV files or REST endpoints) and returns it in a normalized format: a list of [AbstractTransaction](src/dali/abstract_transaction.py) instances. This list can contain instances of any `AbstractTransaction` subclass: [InTransaction](src/dali/in_transaction.py) (acquired crypto), [OutTransaction](src/dali/out_transaction.py) (disposed-of crypto) or [IntraTransaction](src/dali/intra_transaction.py) (crypto transferred across accounts controlled by the same person or by people filing together);
* join the lists returned by plugin load() calls and pass them to the [transaction resolver](src/dali/transaction_resolver.py), which merges incomplete transactions, filling in any missing information (e.g. the spot price) and returning a normalized list of transactions (see below for more details);
* pass the resolved data to the RP2 [ODS input file generator](src/dali/ods_generator.py) and the RP2 [config file generator](src/dali/config_generator.py), which create the input files for RP2.

### The Transaction Resolver
The [transaction resolver](src/dali/transaction_resolver.py) is a critical component of DaLI and has the purpose of merging and normalizing transaction data from data loader plugins. Data loader plugins operate on incomplete information: e.g. if a transaction transfers crypto from Coinbase to Trezor, the Coinbase data loader plugin has no way of knowing that the destination address represents a Trezor account (because Coinbase itself doesn't have this information): so the plugin cannot fill the `to_exchange`, `to_holder` and `crypto_received` fields of the IntraTransaction (so it fills them with `Keyword.UNKNOWN`). Similarly the Trezor data loader plugin cannot know that the source address belongs to a Coinbase account and therefore it cannot fill the `from_exchange`, `from_holder` and `crypto_sent` fields of the IntraTransaction. So how does DaLI merge these two incomplete transaction parts into one complete IntraTransaction? It uses the transaction resolver, which relies on the `unique_id` field of each incomplete transaction to pair them: typically this is the transaction hash, but in certain cases it could also be an exchange-specific value that identifies uniquely the transaction. The transaction resolver analyzes all generated transactions, looks for pairs of incomplete ones with the same `unique_id` and merges them into a single one.

For this reason it's essential that all data loader plugins populate the `unique_id` field as best they can: without it the transaction resolver cannot merge incomplete data. Sometimes hash information is missing (especially in CSV files) and so it's impossible to populate the `unique_id` field: in such cases it's still possible to write a plugin, but the user will have to manually modify the generated result and perform transaction resolution manually, which is not ideal.

### Plugin Development
All data loader plugins are subclasses of [AbstractInputPlugin](src/dali/abstract_input_plugin.py) and they must:
* invoke the superclass constructor in their own constructor;
* implement the load() method, which reads data from the native source and returns a list of [AbstractTransaction](src/dali/abstract_transaction.py) instances, which can be of any of the following classes: [InTransaction](src/dali/in_transaction.py) (acquired crypto), [OutTransaction](src/dali/out_transaction.py) (disposed-of crypto) or [IntraTransaction](src/dali/intra_transaction.py) (crypto transferred across accounts controlled by the same person or by people filing together). The fields of transaction classes are described [here](docs/configuration_file.md#manual-section-csv).

Data loader plugins live in one of the following directories, depending on their type (CSV or REST):
* `src/dali/plugin/input/csv/`;
* `src/dali/plugin/input/rest/`.

If a field is unknown the plugin can fill it with `Keyword.UNKNOWN`, unless it's an optional field (check its type hints in the Python code), in which case it can be `None`.

For an example of CSV-based data loader look at the [Trezor](src/dali/plugin/input/csv/trezor.py) plugin, for an example of REST-based data loader look at the [Coinbase](src/dali/plugin/input/rest/coinbase.py) plugin.

### Plugin Laundry List
When submitting a new data loader plugin open a [PR](https://github.com/eprbell/dali-rp2/pulls) and make sure all the following bullet points apply to your code:
1. the plugin is privacy-focused: it doesn't send user data anywhere;
2. the plugin follows the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md#contributing-to-the-repository);
3. the plugin lives in `src/dali/plugin/input/csv/` or `src/dali/plugin/input/rest/`, depending on its type;
4. the plugin creates transactions that have `unique_id` populated (typically with the hash), unless the information is missing from the native source: this is essential to the proper operation of the [transaction resolver](#the-transaction-resolver);
5. CSV plugins have a comment at the beginning of the file, documenting the format. E.g.:
    ```
    # CSV Format: timestamp; type; transaction_id; address; fee; total
    ```
6. REST plugins have three comments at the beginning of the file, containing links to:
  * REST API documentation
  * authentication procedure documentation
  * URL of the REST endpoint

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This makes it easier to review the code. For example:
```
    # REST API: https://developers.coinbase.com/api/v2
    # Authentication: https://developers.coinbase.com/docs/wallet/api-key-authentication
    # Endpoint: https://api.coinbase.com
```
7. the plugin's `load()` method is implemented and returns a list of AbstractTransaction subclasses;
8. the plugin's `__init__()` method calls the superclass constructor:
    ```
    super().__init__(account_holder)
    ```
9. the plugin's `__init__()` method creates a plugin-specific logger with a name that uniquely identifies the specific instance of the plugin (typically you can add a subset of constructor parameters to ensure uniqueness): this way log lines can be easily distinguished by plugin instance. Example of a plugin-specific log in the constructor of the Trezor plugin:
    ```
        self.__logger: logging.Logger = create_logger(f"{self.__TREZOR}/{currency}/{self.__account_nickname}/{self.account_holder}")
    ```
10. the plugin uses `self.__logger.debug()` throughout its code to capture all native-format data (which is is useful for debugging). Note that `logger.debug()` calls only occur if the user sets `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`;
11. CSV plugins have one or more [unit test](tests/);
12. REST plugins have one or more [unit tests](tests/): use pytest-mock to simulate network calls (see [test_plugin_coinbase.py](tests/test_plugin_coinbase.py) for an example of this);
13. the plugin and its initialization parameters are documented in s section in [docs/configuration_file.md](docs/configuration_file.md#data-loader-plugin-sections).
