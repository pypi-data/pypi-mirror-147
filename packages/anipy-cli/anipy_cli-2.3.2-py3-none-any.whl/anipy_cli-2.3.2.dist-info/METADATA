# Installation

Recommended installation:

`python3 -m pip install anipy-cli --upgrade`

Directly from the repo (may be newer):

`python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/sdaqo/anipy-cli`

Other methodes can be found in [docs/install.md](https://github.com/sdaqo/anipy-cli/blob/master/docs/install.md)

For Videoplayback mpv is needed get it here: https://mpv.io/installation/

Optionally you can install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) to download m3u8 playlists instead of the internal downloader. Use it with the -f flag. This is something you only want to enable when the internal downlaoder fails, since its pretty slow.

# Usage  
```
usage: anipy_cli.py [-h] [-q QUALITY] [-H] [-d] [-D] [-b] [-s] [-f] [-c]

Play Animes from gogoanime in local video-player or Download them.
