# EVO-CC: An Open-Source Classification-Based Nature-Inspired Optimization Clustering Framework in Python

**Description**: The framework is an open source and cross-platform framework implemented in Python which uses the classification technique with the evolutionary clustering approach provided by the EvoCluster framework. The goal of this framework is to provide a user-friendly and customizable implementation of the classification-based evolutionary clustering which can be utilized by experienced and non-experienced users for different applications. The framework can also be used by researchers who can benefit from the framework for their research studies.

**Framework folders and files:**
1.  EvoCluster folder 
2.  Dataset folder 
3.  Classification file
4.  Examples files
