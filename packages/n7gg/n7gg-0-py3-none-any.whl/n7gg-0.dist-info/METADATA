# n7gg

URL service, you probably don't want it.

Listens on :4242, and vends redirects or text responses for a static set
of keys, and 404's for everything else. Updating the set of known keys
currently requires updating `app.py` and restarting the service.

May someday read keys from a config file at startup maybe. /shrug


Usage
-----

Use the script:

    $ ./run.sh

Alternately, edit and install `n7gg.service` with systemd to exec `run.sh`.
