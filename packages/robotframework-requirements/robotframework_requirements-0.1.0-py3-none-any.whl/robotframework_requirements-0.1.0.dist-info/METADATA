# Requirements checking library for Robot Framework

## Introduction

Robotframework-requirements is a library that verifies all packages in
requirements.txt are installed and correct version. If missing or incorrect
versions of packages are found, warning is shown

## Usage

It should be enough to add library to Settings part of your suite and it will
give warnings for incorrect requirements.

file.

```Robot
    *** Settings ***
    Library    RequirementsLibrary    ${CURDIR}/../requirements.txt
```

It is also possible to run library check during test run.

```Robot

    *** Test Cases ***
    Test Requirements
        Check Libraries

```
